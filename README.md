# Overview
  Goal:
  Help Rescue Freedom International make data driven decisions about how to optimize their resources to help end sexual slavery.

  How:
  Scraped data from Global slavery index, Global Modern slavery directory and adjust to only include sexual slavery. I calculated two features, Government effort and Non-Government Organization effort to try to determine what countries are not sufficiently addressing the needs of sexual slaves. Unfortunately, this didn't separate the countries enough to give Rescue Freedom a reasonable group of countries to consider for future growth. So to separate the countries further I used a third feature of vulnerabilty which allowed me to identfy 5 countries with both insufficient Government and NGO efforts, as well as high vulnerabilty which gives Rescue Freedom a reasonable set of countries to consider.
